I've just learned about the existence of [Pachinko vinyl](https://pinballnovice.blogspot.com/2025/07/pachinkol-vinyl.html), as in special promo records released in Japan during the Seventies for the famous arcade game. Thanks to this [MrGneis](https://archive.org/details/@mrgneiss) we can listen to them via the Internet Archive.
