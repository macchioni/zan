Ritratti, reportage, approfondimenti e saggi personali: una newsletter di giornalismo letterario. Il lunedÃ¬, ogni due settimane.

<blockquote>
      We can build co-ops, we can build public benefit corporations. The only way you can truly stay customer-obsessed is by not becoming beholden to venture capital and shareholders in the first place. The benefit of the customer should always come before driving shareholder value - in the modern world, this is reversed, and worse for everyone. Donâ€™t take the buy-out deal! Donâ€™t chase rounds of private funding! Focus on the people. Focus on keeping money in your community. Tech unions are good, but better yet is for the employees to maintain ownership of the company itself. If they love the customers, theyâ€™ll generally do the right thing.
